Half-Life Standard SDK:

Questions about the SDK should be sent to het3@valvesoftware.com.

Contents:

SourceCode:

The directory containing all the code to the game DLL required to create multiplayer add-ons for Half-Life, or bots.  Also included is the source code to all the compiling utilities for the carious elements of Half-Life.

Server Info:

Server protocol.txt contains all the information folks should need if they wish to write a separate net game launcher.

Models:

The models provided should give a good example of the possibilities for building characters for use with Half-Life.  Examples are provided of characters and weapons that appear in the game, to allow modellers to familiarize themselves with the character building process.

PlayerModels: animations, textures, and .qc scripts for the Player Models (all shipped versions).

WeaponModels: world model and view model with animations of the Assault Rifle and Gluon Gun.

Maps:

Two of the opening maps from Half-Life, with their lighting radiosity files, are provided as they contain good examples of some of the most complicated entity scripting to be found within the game. They should serve as a good source for learning how to use the more powerful HL entities like multisource, multimanager, scipted_sequence, AIscripted_sequence, and scripted_sentence.  A third map, env_beam, is a demo map of various beam effects that can be achieved with the env_beam entity.
